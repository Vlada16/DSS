<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p align="left">
    In today's busy world, sports lovers often struggle to find and book sports courts.
    They face problems like not knowing where courts are available or dealing with conflicting reservations,
    leading to disputes or wasted playing time. There's no centralized platform for feedback on court quality,
    maintenance, and safety, which makes things even more challenging. Unclear pricing and uncertain availability
    add to the difficulties.</p>
<h2>Solution / Value Proposition</h2>
<p>Introducing PlayFieldPro, a modern platform that connects court owners with passionate players.
It allows users to easily book sports courts in real-time, with clear pricing and a system for leaving reviews.
The user-friendly design helps people find and reserve their preferred courts without any hassle.
Real-time availability prevents scheduling conflicts, and transparent pricing ensures no hidden costs.
The genuine user review system provides valuable insights, helping players make informed choices.</p>
<h2>Customer Segments</h2>
<p>PlayFieldPro caters to various groups of people.
This includes sports court owners who want to increase their bookings and make their management smoother,
as well as individual players, whether they play for fun or professionally. Sports clubs and organizations
that need regular or large bookings can also benefit. Coaches and trainers, who constantly need access to courts for training sessions,
are also a significant part of the platform's users.</p>
<h2>Competition</h2>
<p>In the competitive market, there are local websites for booking sports facilities that have been around for a while.
 Some people still use older methods like calling or visiting in person to book courts. Of course, there are also other
 online platforms offering similar services.</p>
<h2>Advantage Over Competition</h2>
<p>PlayFieldPro has several advantages over its competitors.
While many platforms focus on just one or two sports, PlayFieldPro covers a wide range, making sure everyone feels included.
The feedback system isn't just for show, it's a crucial part of how the platform ensures quality.
The real-time scheduling feature prevents double bookings.
Its strong cloud-based system ensures data security, easy expansion, and access from anywhere.
Plus, PlayFieldPro is always evolving, regularly updating its features based on what users want.</p>
<h2>Key Metrics</h2>
<p>In any business, what guides its path are the metrics it uses.
For PlayFieldPro, the number of active users is crucial, showing how much it's growing and how widely it's used.
The number of monthly bookings shows how much the courts are in demand and how important the platform is.
The user retention rate indicates how satisfied and reliable users find the platform, while the average revenue per user (ARPU) shows how well the platform is doing financially.
Lastly, how quickly court owners join the platform shows how much it's expanding.</p>
<h2>Cost Structure</h2>
<p>Understanding the costs is essential for financial responsibility.
PlayFieldPro's costs include creating and maintaining the app, which involves regular updates and server expenses.
A substantial part of the budget is set aside for marketing and acquiring customers, like advertising, promotions, and forming partnerships.
The integrated payment system comes with transaction fees. Providing a smooth user experience needs a dedicated customer support system,
 and operational costs cover salaries and utilities, which are essential for the business.</p>
<h2>Revenue Streams</h2>
<p>PlayFieldPro earns revenue through various channels.
Its main source is the booking fees, a small percentage taken from each court reservation.
Court owners can also access special features through subscription models, like detailed analytics or promotional opportunities.
Because of its broad reach, the platform attracts advertisement revenue from sports-related brands.
Partnerships with top sports brands and lucrative affiliate programs also contribute to its success in the market. </p>

<h2>Guidelines and questions for interviews</h2>
<p align="left">
The proposed questions have the potential to bring more clarity to the needs, desires, and expectations of different categories of users
(people who rent sports facilities, property owners, and coaches). By understanding the psychology of users and their experiences, we can develop
a more efficient and personalized application. These questions can indicate to us: understanding the needs of users, user segmentation,
the development of key features, marketing strategies, and the optimization of the user experience..</p>

<p align="left">
    <b> <span style="color:blue;"> The first category </span> </b> of users of the application is coaches. We have prepared a set of 5 questions for them as follows:<br><br>
    <b><i>Cum v-ați promova sau v-ați găsit clienți pentru sesiunile dumneavoastră de antrenament până acum?</i></b> - Through this question, we can identify the personal marketing strategies of the coach and may provide suggestions for improving the application.<br><br>

    </p>
    
    <p align="left">

    <b><i>Cum gestionați în prezent programările și rezervările pentru terenuri?</i></b> - This provides an overview of the reservation management processes and may suggest potential optimization points.<br><br>

    </p>

    <p align="left">
    <b> <span style="color:blue;"> The third category </span> </b> of users of the application is the customers (those who rent the facilities/book a coach). We have prepared a set of 8 questions for them as follows:<br><br>

    <b><i>Care sunt activitățile tale sportive preferate?</i></b> - This helps identify specific sport preferences and can assist in providing personalized suggestions or offers.<br><br>
    <b><i>Cum ați rezervat ultima dată un teren pentru sporturile pe care le practicați?</i></b> - This question provides insights into the customer's preferences regarding reservation services.<br><br>
    <b><i>Cât de des vă bazați pe recomandările prietenilor sau recenziile de pe Google în ceea ce privește alegerea unui teren de sport?</i></b> - This can offer information about social influence and the credibility of reviews for the user.<br><br>

    <h2>How we identified the problem</h2>
    <p align="left">
        To identify the problem, we analyzed the answers of potential users, trainers and owners to understand
        better their needs, what should be improved for a better experience of the booking process.
        We have analyzed the feedback provided by clients who have rented sports fields before.
        We tried to determine the users' needs through a form to understand what they liked and what they didn't like when they previously rented sports fields.
        We researched what existing solutions are already on the market
        to see what are the problems and complaints faced by the users.</p>

    <h2>What we thought is a solution for the problem</h2>
    <p align="left">
        Develop a user-friendly application for renting sport fields which could offer
        for example easy booking process,transparent pricing, real-time availability and more others.</p>

    <h2>Customer discovery</h2>
    <p align="left">
        First of all, we defined our target audience that would be willing to use our application. 
        We conducted some interviews with the target group through a form to understand their needs. We analyzed the answers from the form with the help of which we tried to define the common problems.
        We tried to validate our assumption considering the feedback of potential users to understand if our product could solve their problems.</p>

    <h2>How interviews affected our product</h2>
    <p align="left">
        Following the interviews, we tried to improve the experience that users will have by adding more detailed information about the rental process.We added the option to choose a coach according to each user's preferences.
We streamlined and optimized the reservation management for the owners of sports fields. </p>

<h2>Who we brought to the landing page</h2>
<p align="left">
    We brought our friends and acquaintances and the people we interviewed and some of their friends. 
    We also posted on Facebook groups dedicated to sports and college groups that aim to initiate a start-up.
</p>

<h2>Leading campaign</h2>
<p align="left">
    We don’t think we are there yet with our offering. We have analytics, and we can measure the conversion rate 
    by how many visitors enter an email address, and how many click the Rezerva un teren! button and also other sections of the booking flow.
</p>
<p align="left">
After evaluating the results, we found that the most effective channel was social media promotion. This channel not only brought us greater exposure but also attracted participants who were interested and dedicated to our initiative. 
Therefore, the online promotion strategy proved to be the most efficient in achieving our goals.

    The Politehnica National University of Science and Technology Bucharest boasts a student body exceeding 10,000
    individuals, all keenly interested in engaging in their favorite sports. Additionally, the city of Bucharest is
    home to an active and sports-oriented population of 200.000 citizens. Our mission is to promote a culture of
    sportsmanship, encouraging everyone, including students, to participate in activities such as football,
    basketball, and various other sports to enhance their skills and overall well-being.
</p>

<p align="left">
    Bucharest currently offers a substantial infrastructure for sports enthusiasts, with over 50 football courts
    and 100 basketball fields available for rental. The demand for these facilities is consistently on the rise,
    driven by the influx of students choosing Bucharest as their destination for academic pursuits. The abundance of
    both football courts and basketball fields, each paired with its respective owner, creates a promising landscape
    for our web application, providing ample opportunities for these venue owners to promote their spaces effectively.
</p>
<p align="left">
This results in an estimate of an addressable market of 250 000 in Bucharest.

The competition appears to be in a niche with varying offerings, such as tennis-focused platforms like BookSport and SudArena. The overall market size, as indicated by the traffic figures, suggests a segment that is currently of moderate size, offering opportunities for strategic differentiation and targeted growth initiatives. Understanding this landscape can help in formulating a market strategy tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the Romanian sports enthusiasts.
Based on the provided data, we can estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for sports enthusiasts seeking court reservations to be in the range of 4,000 to 6,000 individuals. Recognizing that not all players may prefer using apps and may rely on traditional methods like word of mouth or direct calls to find courts, we conservatively estimate the Serviceable Available Market (SAM) to be approximately 25% of the TAM.

Considering the existing competition in the field, many of which lack modern UI/UX features or offer a limited range of sports, we project the Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) to be around 30% of the SAM. This implies that our platform could potentially serve 1,000 to 1,500 sports enthusiasts within the Serviceable Available Market, with an achievable portion of 300 to 450 users. This analysis accounts for both the broader market potential and the specific factors that may influence user adoption within the identified market segments.
